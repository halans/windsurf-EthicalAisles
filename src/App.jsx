            <h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
            <p><strong>We believe that every purchase is a choiceâ€”and a voice.</strong><br/>
            A voice for local jobs. For ethical sourcing. For a cleaner planet.<br/>
            Too many supermarket shelves are stacked with brands that pollute, exploit, and profit without conscience.</p>
            <p><strong>We say: enough.</strong><br/>
            We choose transparency over trickery.<br/>
            We choose small over sprawling.<br/>
            We choose Australian-made, fair, and sustainable over multinational convenience.</p>
            <p><strong>This isnâ€™t about guilt.<br/>Itâ€™s about empowerment.</strong><br/>
            Swap the brand. Keep the product. Make the impact.</p>
            <p><strong>Vote with your cart. Shop with heart.</strong></p>
